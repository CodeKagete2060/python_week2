# Python List Manipulation Script

## Overview  
This Python script demonstrates basic and common list operations including appending elements, inserting at a specific position, extending a list with another list, removing elements, sorting, and finding the index of a specific value. It is a simple example designed to showcase foundational list handling techniques in Python.

## Features  
- Creates an empty list and appends integer elements to it.  
- Inserts an element at a specified position.  
- Extends the list by adding elements from another list.  
- Removes the last element from the list.  
- Sorts the list in ascending order.  
- Finds and outputs the index of a specific value (30 in this case).  
- Prints the final list and the found index to the console.

## How to Run  
1. Save the script as `list_manipulation.py` (or any preferred filename).  
2. Run the script using Python 3:
3. Observe the output in the console, showing the final sorted list and the index position of the value 30.

## Learning Outcome  
This script provides practical experience with core Python list methods, helping beginners gain familiarity with:

- `append()`  
- `insert()`  
- `extend()`  
- `pop()`  
- `sort()`  
- `index()`  

It is a useful reference for those starting to learn Python data structures and basic list operations.
